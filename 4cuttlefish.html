The "cuttle" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the species, <I cudelev </I> which may be cognate with the <em >Old Norse koddi (cushion)</em> and the<em Middle Low German Kudel (rag) </em>.[6] The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish as a <strong>source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed</strong>. The word for it in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English.
